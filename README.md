Mario Memory is a memory game using ReactJS.  The player selects a character to start.  They have to keep selecting characters until they run out of characters.  Every unique character they get, adds to their score.  Once the game ends, if their score is higher than the high score, their score becomes the new high score.

**User Stories**
1) I want to test my memory skills.
2) I want a nice kid-friendly game for my children.

**Issues**
This is my first project using ReactJS.  Once I finished creating the static UI, I had to figure out how to pass data along between the components.  Using state and props was a new concept for me in this project.

**Future Improvements**
1) Shake the cards when the user selects the same character twice.
2) Play a sound effect on character selection.
3) Flash the title when the user gets the answer wrong.

**Technologies User**
1) HTML/CSS
2) JavaScript
3) ReactJS
