Mario Memory
* Mario Memory is a memory game using ReactJS.  The player selects a character to start.  They have to keep selecting characters until they run out of characters.  Every unique character they get, adds to their score.  Once the game ends, if their score is higher than the high score, their score becomes the new high score.  At the bottom of the page, there is a "hidden" button that takes the user to Sonic-inspired version of the game.

Process/Issues

Future Improvements

2) Modal with incorrect character image
